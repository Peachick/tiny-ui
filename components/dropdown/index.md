# Dropdown

A drop-down list is a graphical control element, similar to a list box.

## Scenario

When there are more than a few options to choose from, you can wrap them in a `Dropdown`. By hovering or clicking on the trigger, a dropdown menu will appear, which allows you to choose an option and execute the relevant action.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Dropdown } from 'tiny-ui';
```

## Examples

<layout>
  <column>
    <Basic />
    <Other />
    <Cascade />
  </column>
  <column>
    <Placement />
    <Trigger />
    <Close />
  </column>
</layout>
